# Resourcelog
Way to keep and share your web resources

# The problem

In todays world we often have a lot of sources of interesting links that we'd like to keep. We use Facebook, Twitter, Slack, IRC, 
WhatsApp... you name it. It creates this huge mess, a specially that not every posted link is valuable to us at the end. 

Once in a while you'd like to find a link you saw a few months ago but it's actually impossible to search all those mediums. 

# The solution

A tool that is hooked up to all your channels and populates internal list that you can curate and filter out irrelevant ones.

## Features to include:

* fetch data from different channels using plugin system. Fetching data from other Resourcelogs should  be included
* only currated links stay
* links can be re-shared to other channels (so that my friends from work can get a funny cat picture my buddy shared on facebook)
* __ideas__?
